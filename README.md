## Description

Webapp for  listing breweries across the country and pinning them on google maps, with an option to add brewery and its product if you notice your favorite place missing from the list. Full stack, CRUD functional app will be made in conjunction with Next.JS on the front end combined with one of CSS frameworks and libraries for touchups (to be decided). On the back end, api will be built with Ruby on Rails with two (possibly three /+MVP) models. One-to-many relation will be established between Brewery and the products it carries. If there's enough time towards the end I hope to implement users authentication. 
Possible utilization of MaterializeCSS and some animation libraries.
